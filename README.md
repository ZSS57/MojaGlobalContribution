## Project: Developing a FLINT Forest Monitoring tool using Land Sector datasets

Overall objective:

1, Study the Land Sector datasets and sketch out a data workflow to intelligently identify small squares of forest worldwide.  

2, Develop a Python-based tool to produce GCBM configurations for the identified squares and dispatch simulations using the FLINT.Cloud templates.  

3, Integrate a CI/CD-based workflow to push generated results to a remote MongoDB Atlas instance while applying rules-based projections.  

4, Document the results on public Moja Global documentation and offer a template to users looking to try the above.
